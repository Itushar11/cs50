              This chapter continues the study of CSS begun earlier and introduces techniques for positioning and floating web page elements, including a two- column CSS page layout. New HTML5 semantic elements and techniques to provide HTML5 compatibility for older browsers are also introduced. Sample solutions for the Hands-On Practice are available in the student files.

              Like when I filled up my car with gas, drove away, and KLAANK! I had forgotten to take the gas nozzle out of my car. It’s a miracle I didn’t blow the place up. And the times my wife kept telling me, “I just don’t feel connected to you anymore.” She’s now my ex-wife. It wasn’t like I was completely clueless about time management. I had read all the bestsellers. I was the master of the to-do list and prioritized it every night for the next day. At one point I had such a long list that I used a standard piece of ruled notebook paper and filled in two columns—35 ruled lines, 2 tasks per line, 70 total to-do items. I look back at that time in my life with horror and embarrassment.
 
              Thankfully, today I’m a different person. I’m a single dad with three kids. I help them with their homework every night and am home 
              for dinner at the kitchen table more than half the time. I attend most of their games, plays, and music recitals. I’m no athlete, but I exercise routinely and am maintaining a healthy weight. I manage at least one or two “date nights” with my girlfriend each week.

              What I discovered is that highly successful people don’t prioritize tasks on a to-do list, or follow some complex five-step system, or refer to logic tree diagrams to make decisions. Actually, highly successful people don’t think about time much at all. Instead, they think about values, priorities, and consistent habits. While no two people manage time exactly the same way, there are common themes. And if you really try them, you might find that just one of their “secrets” has the power to transform your career and your life
